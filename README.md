PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------

In this we are using **ANPR **technique to recognize the number plates. Further
**ALPR** will be connected to Raspberry pi to set up the circuit. People will
have an application on their mobile device with which they can book the parking
spots before hand and make the payments accordingly, so that when they come in
they don’t have to wait for too long to have the parking. It will show the exact
parking locations, the vacancies, booked areas etc. Everything will be connected
to the database. The user can prolong the parking spot before the time has been
expired as they will get the reminder in their app that the timeout will be in
few minutes.

 

HOW THIS PROJECT DEALS WITH THE REAL WORLD?
-------------------------------------------

In this era of busy life when people are rushing to meet their requirements, we
have given birth to so many problems. Parking lot problems have become a major
issue these days in most of the institutes.

This project is based on the build of hardware portion that will connect to a
database as well as to a mobile device application.
