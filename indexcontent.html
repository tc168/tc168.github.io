			When the car come through the gate , the development board will  request a visual input of the carâ€™s license plate, and translates that to data into the database. After the system finishes processing the image. It will display a red led to indicate that its finished and can go ahead to open the gate. 

		</p>

		<H4>Bill of Materials/Budget</H4>
		<p>
			The suggested goal of this project is to create a  base system to less than $200 and beyond that we would want to scale the capability of the system with necessary sensor to create the smart parking experience . This means that to handle additional cars we would need additional  10$ ultrasonic sensor to fit the necessary cars to be in the parking system.

		</p>



		<H4>Time Commitment</H4>
		<p>
			Based on the Gantt chart I allocated around 60 hours in total for the group. So with the effort as an individual it's a effort of around 15 hour continuous work to get my outcome to work. 

			<br>

			If I were to divide the hours it would be 6 hours that was for planning and defining the problem. After it would be around 2 hours dedicated to soldering the pcb parts and 4 hours to install and combine all the software working part. The remaining 3 hours were used to test and understand the parking system better.

		<H4>Mechanical Assembly</H4>
		<p>
			The Mechanical Assembly consist of combining the sense hat created from the Humber prototype lab with the Raspberry Pi. Afterward there was a need to connect the webcam through a wifi network the webcam provided.

			<H4>PCB / Soldering</H4>
			<p>
				The PCB parts that i needed mainly was the LED light that can be controlled through the GPIO pin , i needed this visual indicator to allow other people to know when the system is running and executing the image processing on the raspberry pi

				<H4>Unit Testing</H4>
				<p>
					The unit testing i have done with  my system concerns the camera, So i did multiple tests to ensure i get a best distance that my image recognition is best recognized. This is mainly shown in week 12

				</p>


				<H4>Production Testing</H4>
				<p>
					In order to test the whole production of the system , I  demonstrated and integrated the entire system. So what this means is that I attached all my units/parts of my system together.  This includes the video input of the webcam, the raspberry pi , and the LED light with the binding part of the software.

					<br>
					<br>
					The video in week 13 shows how to setup the production testing

				<H4>Is the project reproducible by following your instructions</H4>
				<p>
				This is project is mainly contributed to the following :  <a href="http://lukagabric.com/raspberry-pi-license-plate-recognition/"> website </a> 

<br>
<br>

					One of main thing to get is the all the library to be able to run the program.
					The following gives a detailed explanation of steps to be taken.
					<a href="
					https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/wiki/Compilation-instructions-(Ubuntu-Linux)"> Install Steps </a>

					<br>

					<br>
					sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y openalpr openalpr-daemon openalpr-utils libopenalpr-dev
					Installing all this will allow us to run the special commands 

					<br>
					<br>

					Afterward  there is a need to install an ip camera app called ip webcam on  the android device

					<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en
"> Camera App </a>

































































































































					<br>

					This is a need to download a driver to make sure that the ip camera stream is recognized as a physical stream on the raspberry device so.There a program needed called 
					<a href="http://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/installation/"> uv4l </a> 
					
<br>

					So inside my Project the connectWebcam.sh need to be editted to the correct ip address of the webstream. 
<br>

					After sh connectWebcam.sh
					To run the program you should show a image of license plate around 45 cm away from your camera in a clear visible view and execute the script file 

<br>
					sh displayplate.sh

<br>
					This should give an output of

						Project Status


						<br>

						<p> The main purpose of this week is to find and test the optimal point the camera should be pointed to. 

							So some of requirements to allow the license plate to read is to have 
							<br>
							1. High accuracy of the plate and correct of the plate
							<br>
							2. Correct distance from camera
							<br>
							3. Full vision of plate



							I am aware that my testing sample is small and there some consistency on the photo due to field of vision need to be 

							adjusted.



							The testing method is taking tests of the plate is vision and changing the distance from the image to the camera with increments of 15 cm



						</p>





						<img src="/image/test_result/ea7the.jpg" alt="orignal image" width="128" height="128">

						<br>

						This is the original license plate that being used

						<br>



						<img src="/image/test_result/15cm.png" alt="15 cm test" >

						<br>

						This is the result of 15 cm 

						<br>



						<img src="/image/test_result/30cm.png" alt="30 cm test" >

						<br>

						This is the result of 30 cm 

						<br>

						<img src="/image/test_result/45 cm.png" alt="45 cm test" >

						<br>

						This is the result of 45 cm 

						<br>

						<img src="/image/test_result/60cm.png" alt="60 cm test" >

						<br>

						This is the result of 60 cm 

						<br>

						<img src="/image/test_result/75cm.png" alt="75 cm test" >

						<br>

						This is the result of 75 cm 

						<br>

						<br>



						<p> 

							So the observation is the plate is giving the correct plate number from 15 cm to 

							60cm. On the 75cm distance its getting the wrong distance. 

							<br>

							<br>



							Another way to find the optimal distance is making sure the first result has a very high confidence.

							so this occurs around 15 cm to 45 cm with around 90% confidence of what the license plate is trying to recognize.

							<br> 

							<br>

							The final thing to filter out to figure out the best distance is to make sure the 2nd confidence level should be a big delta compared to the first

							confidence level plate. This will ensure that it is less likely that the 2nd wrong license plate to be recognized as first guess plate.

							Looking into the data around 30 cm and 45 cm ensure around 8% or 10% difference. Thus around 30 cm and between 45 will become the best result.

							<br>

							<br>

							So with all considerations it seems the image at 45 cm is deemed to be best distance to take photo of the plate numbers


							<p>

								Currently for the project there is consideration of switching to a proper camera in the future and there might

								be some component to remove depending on the functionally of project this might remove the LCD display.  <a href="/documentation/Billofmaterial.docx"> Budget </a>
								So it is currently way less to our inital guess of 200$ as of now

								Project Status <br>

								<p> After the open house , I learnt from when I was demoing  the camera. It  was at times abit fickle due to the range and accuracy 
									of the camera and resoultion it needs to recongize. 
									There was also issue with power consumption of the device / heat of the camera if it need to run constantly so there should
									be a way to turn it on and off when a sensor is asked for. Also there should be more hardware sensors addded to intergrate the whole project.
									Currently the financial for the camera is really dependant on what the camera fits or need, ethier a connected camera or a wireless ip camera to 
									be used.

									The project is behind on the hardware reading some sensors and the softwares is mostly done

											Currently I attached the lcd as for the build. The camera module missing  due to being backlog at my store, and the board is missing that going to come later.
											Some issues we found with our previous budget was that the sensor we orginally planned was not capable to run on the raspberry PI so we ordered a cheaper 
											ultrasonic HC-SR04 senor that allowed us to fit 2 sensors rather than 1.

																					<li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
																					<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
																					<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a

																						<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login at: <a
